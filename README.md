# Not Falling Block Addon

The "Not Falling Block" addon introduces a custom mob that behaves like a regular block but has unique properties. It has no gravity, is invisible, and makes the frames unbreakable and impossible to rotate, making them untouchable. This feature also extends to tables, armor stands, and more.

## Usage

To use the addon, follow these steps:

1. Type `/function nfb` in a repeat command block.
2. To remove the mob, run the following command:
`/kill @e[type=lootland:notfalling_block,r=1]`
3. To obtain the spawn egg, use the following command:
`/give @p lootland:notfallingblockspawn_egg`
